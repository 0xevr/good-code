## Database Schema

```sql
-- Users table (extend existing)
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN stripe_customer_id VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN subscription_status ENUM('active', 'past_due', 'canceled', 'trialing');

-- Subscriptions table
CREATE TABLE subscriptions (
  id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
  stripe_subscription_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
  plan_type ENUM('standard', 'premium'),
  status VARCHAR(50),
  current_period_start TIMESTAMP,
  current_period_end TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Payments table
CREATE TABLE payments (
  id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
  stripe_payment_intent_id VARCHAR(255),
  amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  currency VARCHAR(3) DEFAULT 'USD',
  status VARCHAR(50),
  service_type VARCHAR(100),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Bookings table (extend to link with payments)
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN payment_id VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES payments(id);
```

## Moroccan Payment Considerations

### Local Payment Methods
1. **Bank Transfers** - Popular for larger amounts
2. **Cash on Delivery** - Not applicable for digital services
3. **Mobile Money** - Consider for future expansion

### Compliance
- **Tax**: Apply 20% VAT for Moroccan customers
- **Invoicing**: Generate proper invoices in Arabic/French
- **Banking**: Ensure compliance with Moroccan banking regulations

## Security Measures

### Data Protection
- Never store card details on servers
- Use Stripe's secure vault for all sensitive data
- Implement proper HTTPS and security headers
- Regular security audits and PCI compliance

### Fraud Prevention
- Enable Stripe Radar for fraud detection
- Implement rate limiting on payment endpoints
- Monitor for unusual payment patterns
- Require SCA (Strong Customer Authentication) for EU customers

## Testing Strategy

### Development Environment
```bash
# Stripe test mode configuration
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_test_...
```

### Test Scenarios
